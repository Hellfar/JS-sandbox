# JS sandbox

A basic JS sandbox

(Works fine on Firefox.38 and Opera.29, don't know about the others)

Project type: This projects are not usefull or crazy, that just represents testing JS features to determine my own needs for a JS library, thus all this repo is dedicated to myself.

Main current lack:
- json converter (beta)
- values binder
- expression parser
