Object
======

Starting base to develop the JSON convertion.
The goal here is to make a codec converter for a json into any json node type. Here I began for jsons into forms, but I planed to make jsonParams able to convert jsons into everything (I am actually thinking about changing the template parameter behavior).
I planed to make it able to convert to:
- SVG shapes
- any html diplaying
- etc

- - -

I also planed to make this sandbox project having a recursive display, so we can make Object into Object for example.
